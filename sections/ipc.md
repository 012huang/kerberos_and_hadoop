# Hadoop IPC Security

The Hadoop IPC system handles Kerberos ticket and Hadoop token authentication automatically.

1. The identity of the principals of services are configured in the hadoop site configuration
files.
1. Every IPC services uses java annotations, a metadata resource file and a custom `SecurityInfo`
subclass to define the security information of the IPC, including the key in the configuration
used to define the principal.
1. If a caller making a connection has a valid token (auth or delegate) it is used
to authenticate with the remote principal.
1. If a caller lacks a token, the Hadoop ticket will be used to acquire an authentication
token.
1. Applications may explicitly request delegation tokens to forward to other processes.
1. Delegation tokens are renewed in a background thread (which?).

## Adding a new IPC interface to a Hadoop Service/Application

This is "fiddly". It's not impossible, it just involves effort.

In its favour: it's a lot easier than SPNEGO.

### `SecurityInfo` subclass

Every exported RPC service will need its own extension of the `SecurityInfo` class, to provide two things:

1. The name of the principal to use in this communication
1. The token used to authenticate ongoing communications.

### `PolicyProvider` subclass

A `PolicyProvider` subclass. This is used to inform the RPC infrastructure of the ACL policy: who may talk to the service. It must be explicitly passed to the RPC server

		rpcService.getServer()
		  .refreshServiceAcl(serviceConf, new MyRPCPolicyProvider());

### `SecurityInfo` resource file

The resource file `META-INF/services/org.apache.hadoop.security.SecurityInfo` lists all RPC APIs which have a matching SecurityInfo subclass in that JAR.

		org.apache.example.appmaster.rpc.RPCSecurityInfo

The RPC framework will read this file and build up the security information for the APIs (server side? Client side? both?)


### Authenticating a caller

How does an IPC endpoint validate the caller? If security is turned on,
the client will have had to authenticate with Kerberos, ensuring that
the server can determine the identity of the principal. 

This is something it can ask for when handling the RPC Call:

      UserGroupInformation callerUGI;
      
      // #1: get the current user identity
      try {
        callerUGI = UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser();
      } catch (IOException ie) {
        LOG.info("Error getting UGI ", ie);
        AuditLogger.logFailure("UNKNOWN", "Error getting UGI");
        throw RPCUtil.getRemoteException(ie);
      }
    
The `callerUGI` variable is now set to the identity of the caller. If the caller
has delegated authority (tickets, tokens) then they still authenticate as
that principal they were acting as (possibly via a `doAs()` call).
    
    
      // #2 verify their permissions
      if (!checkAccess(callerUGI, ApplicationAccessType.MODIFY)) {
        AuditLogger.logFailure(callerUGI.getShortUserName(),
            AuditConstants.KILL_CONTAINER_REQUEST,
            "User doesn't have permissions to " + ApplicationAccessType.MODIFY
            AuditConstants.UNAUTHORIZED_USER);
        throw RPCUtil.getRemoteException(new AccessControlException("User "
            + callerUGI.getShortUserName() + " cannot perform operation "
            + ApplicationAccessType.MODIFY_APP.name());
      }

In ths example, there's a check to see if the caller can make a request which modifies
something in the service, if not the calls is rejected.

Note how failures are logged to an audit log; successful operations should be logged too.
The purpose of the audit log is determine the actions of a principal â€”both successful
and unsuccessful.
